# Interactive Godot Tutorial

This is an add-on for the godot editor, providing integrated and interactive tutorials explaining the basics of Godot.
It is aimed at children and youth and is used at [CoderDojo Belgium](https://coderdojobelgium.be/nl/), part of the worldwide [CoderDojo Foundation](https://coderdojo.com/en).

The tutorials will teach you the basics of the engine and gdscript up to a point where you can start making your own (small) games.
Godette, the female Godot mascotte, will explain and guide you through the tutorials _inside_ the editor similar to an in-game tutorial often found in games.

## Installation
Download the Godot engine from the [official Godot website](https://godotengine.org/).

The tutorials addon is closely integrated with the Godot editor, and will probably not work with older versions.
The addon has been tested to work with Godot 4.1.2
You do not need .NET support, the tutorials are gdscript only (currently).

Install the godot engine and create a new empty Godot project.

The official Godot documentation has an excellent [page on installing plugins](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).
Download the latest version of this tutorials addon as a zipfile [here](https://github.com/bgie/igt/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
Open the folder where your new project is located. You can use the file explorer in the editor and right-click on any file to 'Open in File Manager'.
Unzip the addon into the root of your project, so that you get an 'addons' folder containing the 'igt' folder.

Activate the addon by clicking on 'Project' in the main menu, then 'Project Settings'. Go to the 'Plugins' tab and enable the checkbox to the right of 'Interactive Godot Tutorial'.

The tutorials will show up as a new button next to 2D, 3D, Scripts, AssetLib.
